## Neural Networks
- ReLU - Rectified Linear Unit - kind of neuron outputting $max(0, linear function)$ 
## Supervised learning

- Structured data - databases neatly organised into related entities. Unstructured data - images, audio, etc.
- Why are NNs so good suddenly when they've been around for a while? NNs' performance grows much more with the amount of data available to train them, without hitting a plateau, unlike traditional algorithms like SVM.
