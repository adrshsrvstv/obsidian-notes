- Doing hard things is easy, thinking about them is hard. #hard-things
- Expect problems -  expect shit to go wrong.
- Whatever happens,  whatever mistakes you make - acknowledge, forgive, learn.
- Worrying is pointless. Things are anyway unexpected. Enjoy the present, hope more, worry less. #worrying 
- Be like a dustbin with a hole at the bottom - take all the trash life and other people throw at you, but keep none of it once it passes. Let it all go.  If you don't do it, you won't have the capacity to handle the new shit life will inevitably throw at you. #letting-go #being-a-trash-can
- When there's nothing to do, do nothing, even if you're surrounded by troubles from all sides. Don't even worry. Wait for things to change, have a cup of tea if you'd like. And when things change and you can do something, give it your all.
- When there's fear: #fear
	- You can't relax, you are tensed, and there's no way you can innovate #innovation
	- You make more mistakes and are more likely to fail
	- There's no trust, no sense of being a part of the community
- Antidote to fear - kindness, to ourselves and others. #kindness #fear 
- Love yourself just the same as others - not any less, not any more. Give yourself the same kindness, love, and forgiveness as others. #loving-yourself

## Stress #stress
- Are you addicted to stress? Do you believe you'll fail or things will go wrong if you don't take stress? They won't!
- Don't bother with what people think of you - focus on being at peace with yourself
- Don't linger on the past - there's nothing to learn from it - it's only pain and regret. Don't worry of the future - worrying is not about being responsible, it is escaping your present moment. You need your brain space to tackle the challenges you have. You can't waste it on carrying the past around. #letting-go  #past
- Don't learn from the past, learn from the present. #past 
- The fear of failure is not worth it. The experience of trying, of giving it a go and seeing what happens - that IS worth it though, even if you fail. #fear #failing 
## No-Self esteem #self-esteem
- no self-esteem > self-esteem > no-self esteem is how the progression works
- Being at peace with yourself is high self-esteem 
- Good enough is, really, good enough! 
- Don't own things. You don't own your successes, neither your failures. Not your lows, not your highs. We do these things or they happen to us. They are not us, not a part of our identity.
- Why is always attaining the highest standards, always being the best, always being the smartest, most handsome, richest so important? Why is good enough not good enough for you? #good-enough
	- It doesn't mean you settle or be complacent. But not everything needs to be of the highest standard.
	- And whose goals are these anyway? Who set them up for us to chase?
	- More important than being the best, brightest, smartest, richest is being at peace with yourself. Then, you can be successful. #peace #success 
	- Is excellence really all this stress, all this worrying and self-loathing? Or is it doing something you like, something that fulfils you, and doing it as well as you can? Isn't that excellence?
- Lower your expectations.
	- Mistakes are allowed, both by yourself and others
## Four ways of letting go
1. **Throw away everything unnecessary**
	- If you carry so many worries of the future, so many fears from the past, so much weight - you'll get exhausted. And you'll be grumpy. So throw them both away.
	- Have the courage to throw away your worries of the future. It doesn't mean something will go wrong. It can and should be done. 
	- And you don't need to mull over the past to learn from it. You'll learn whatever is there to learn. Let the past and the fears arising from it go too.
	- Throw away your complaining. 
	- Live life more, think about it less.
2. **Know what freedom truly is**
	- When you don't want to be here, you're a prisoner. When you want to be here, you're free and at peace. So want to be here. #freedom 
3. **Give, expecting nothing back in return.**
4. **Have a teflon mind - let nothing stick**
	- No happiness, no sadness, no mementos from life, no knowledge should stick to you
	- Don't let your knowledge stand in the way of truth.  Knowledge is what you know or have been told to be true. Truth is what you experience. Words = knowledge. Experience = Truth.  #seeking-truth

## Good enough?
- We regard others the same way we regard ourselves. If you criticise/judge yourself, you criticise/judge others, and vice-versa. 
- Conversely, if you can be kind to yourself, you can be kind to others. #kindness 
- We can also learn to love ourselves, by learning to love others, even pets/animals.  #loving-yourself
- Being kind to yourself, respecting yourself, having compassion for yourself doesn't mean you'll become proud or complacent. 
- If you think you're good enough, that's when you start to grow - better and better and better and better. When you think there's something wrong with you, you lose confidence and get worse. You're good enough, and then you can get better. #growth #good-enough 

## Fear #fear 
- Fear of criticism: Do and say what you think is the right thing to do and say. Why do you always have to please others? And why do you worry so much about what other people think of you? 
- Go beyond fear. Where you are free to be happy and peaceful. Are you afraid of being truly happy and peaceful? You deserve to be happy no matter who you are and what you have done. #happiness 
- Fear is rooted in attachment - we don't want to lose things - our stuff, our reputation, our partner, our uniqueness - all things we are attached to. 
- And what Fear leads to is controlling - and that results in our fears coming true so many times. All controlling comes from fear. You get too tense, too stressed, you don't let go, and that is why things go wrong because we cannot relax to do the right thing for ourselves. #stress #control
- Letting go means losing control. That means also losing control of your happiness. It can come and go but you cannot control it. And that's ok, get out of the way. Don't be afraid of losing control. Let go. Let yourself find happiness. You deserve happiness and you can do it. Have the courage to let go and see what lies ahead. #letting-go #happiness
- No ~~pain~~ happiness, no gain. #happiness 
## Having a good relationship with life
- Having a good relationship with life means rejecting nothing that it throws at you. Good, bad, ugly - you know you're going to be able to do something with it. 
- It's not what happens to us, but how we respond to it, that creates all the stress, anxiety, anger. Make your peace with it. Everything passes. 
- In any case, what choice do we have, other than dealing with things the best we can while taking care of ourselves first and foremost?
- Nothing lasts - this too shall pass. #impermanence 
## Investing in inner qualities
- Invest in kindness - always positive returns, never loses value.
- Things are never perfect - but we can decide what we look at - what's wrong, or what's right.
- No matter what our situation is, we can choose contentment over disappointment/dissatisfaction.
- Life's not fair, not equitable - but this unfairness, this inequity is an opportunity for us to give when we have more, and be kind/forgiving when we have less or are wronged. 
## Prioritisation
- Big rocks > small rocks > sand > water: Put the big rocks in first, otherwise there'll never be space for them. The smaller things will fit in somehow. But the big rocks have to go in the jar first of all.
- You AND whatever's in front of you - job, partner, life. *You* count too.
- Care, not cure whatever you're dealing with. Even in meditation - curing the present moment, making it peaceful is not the goal. Being present is the goal - caring for this moment is the goal. #care-not-cure 
- Kindness and peace. Be kind and gentle, make peace. 
- King's three questions: What's the most important time?  Now. Who's the most important person? The one in front of you. What's the most important thing to do? To care.
## Good, bad, who knows?!
- Make decisions - then make them work. There's no good or bad. Don't judge. #judging
## Depression
- Be the farmer that gets the eggs from his chicken shed (past) into his home (present) and leaves all the shit behind to become fertiliser, not the one who leaves the eggs behind to rot and brings all the shit into his house. #past #letting-go 
- Doing things wears out the mind. Being *still* replenishes the energy. It's to the mind what exercise is to the body. 
## Disappointment #disappointment
- If you've done your very best, you don't need to be disappointed.
- When you are grounded in reality, when your expectations are real, you are never disappointed. Being grounded in truth and in reality is the very gist of dharma. #expectations
- It's in the trying, not in achieving your goals, that lies your success. If you've done the very best, there's no need to be disappointed. Your job is to care, not cure things, relationships, people. If your priority is to care, you find you can always do that, even when you can't cure something. If it works out or doesn't work out, you've succeeded if you gave it your very best. #care-not-cure #success 
- It doesn't mean we give up on excellence. We just don't chase it, instead care about it. We just go about giving our best, improving constantly, learning constantly. #excellence
- When you don't expect anything, but simply care for things, relationships, and people - we give it all without expecting anything in return.

## Learn not to blame yourself
- Look at the challenges and difficulties in life as learning opportunities. If everything was perfect, life would be boring and static. #hard-things 
- We blame others when we are also used to blaming ourselves. Blaming others is a way to protect ourselves from admitting we could have done something different. We either believe there can be something wrong with people, and blame ourselves and others, or we can try to understand ourselves and others. #self-blame 
- When we are not afraid of admitting our failings and faults and mistakes, then we can accept other's too, without transferring blame. #self-esteem #self-blame 
- Learn to recognize that our failings have more to do with our environment, upbringing, past, circumstances - than just something being wrong with us - or others. 
- When you find yourself blaming others, ask yourself what part of yourself you're not willing to face up. You don't need to fix yourself up - you can change your relationship with life and what it throws at you. Then you can learn from your mistakes, and later transcend them.
## Change the way you look at yourself
- Don't build your identity from the result of the things you do or from what people tell you.
- When you yourself realize who you are - anything else that people say doesn't really matter. You're at peace with yourself and accept yourself. 
- What you've done in the past is not who you are - that's who you were. You have the permission to let it go and move on.
- You can do something stupid or bad. That doesn't make you a stupid or bad person.
- Thinking you're better, worse, or the same as someone else - are the three conceits. Neither of these are true.
