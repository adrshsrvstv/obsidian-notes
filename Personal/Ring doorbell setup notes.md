If wiring directly to a doorbell transformer, connect

a 25 ohm, 50W wirewound resistor in series with one

of the doorbell wires to protect your Ring Doorbell.

Do not connect to a DC transformer, halogen or

lighting transformer, or intercom.

Diode is for digital chimes. Resistor is no chime and doorbell is wired direct to the transformer.

If you wire the Ring to the transformer without a chime, then when the button is depressed it is a dead short across the wires. This might result in damage to the Ring and/or transformer. Worst case, it could start a fire.

The reason the resistor is not needed when you have a chime is that the chime itself supplies the necessary resistance and limits the current flow.
