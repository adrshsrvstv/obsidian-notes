- Energy and focus > time/hours spent

## You're doing time management wrong if:

- You don't have time blocked for your hobbies
- You don't have time blocked for travel/wandering/doing nothing
- You can't find time for taking care of your physical and mental health
- You don't find a silent moment in the day to just be still
- You are always sleep/energy deprived
- You spend your most energetic/focussed times on things that are not the most important to you

## The "time"-management algorithm

- Variables - priority, energy, focus, drive, reward, joy, resilience (?), stress, physical health, relationships, contentment, joy

## Things I had learned about myself from striving in 2019

- Keeping the morning time for the most important things you want to do - gym can be done when you are mentally exhausted, but studies can't be.Â At the same time, a short cardio in the morning does wonders for waking up promptly and being able to focus right. 
- Meditation works best in the morning too - at night you are very often so tired you have little willpower or focus left - you almost doze your way through meditation. 
- Keeping your phone on the table so you don't use it before sleeping or right after waking up
- Not thinking too much on days you feel unsure about going - and simply getting up, getting ready, and going to gym.
- Stacking habits is the best way to maintain them
- Getting things out of your head into a system like asana
- Focussing on compliance during longer periods like a week, instead of hitting goals everyday. Life is unpredictable - factor this into your systems. Instead of saying I'll go to gym MTWTF, say I'll go to gym 5 days a week. 
- Don't start multiple new things at once - it becomes too much mental load to manage.
