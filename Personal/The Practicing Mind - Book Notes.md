- To focus on the present, we must temporarily give up the attachment to our goal. Then, we can focus on the process, not product. Then, all pressure drops away.
- Then, there are no mistakes and no judgements, nothing holding you or keeping you from achieving your goal. You are doing, observing, and course correcting. That is practice. Not a mistake. We are doing everything right - getting it not exactly right is how the process works.
- The goal is a North star to direct our practice towards, but not a measure of how our practice is going.
- Any image of perfection is bound to be frozen and lifeless. When you attain that, then what? True perfection is endless, infinite, ever growing. 
- Thinking about the goal and all the "what ifs" - the possible consequences - already drains our energy - energy we could use to complete the task.
- We want to practice well - by being fully in the present - not to so we could achieve some idea of perfection. We practice because when done right, perfection is right there - in the practice itself - not in some distant future achievement. In that moment, we can be happy and content, free from self imposed pressures and expectations that only come in our way.
- Gather data without emotions. Figure out what needs to be done, without thinking of what will happen if you don't get it right.
- Find your joy in the process - by staying in the present moment. Reaching the goal is momentary, the process is where we spend most of the time. 
- Take some time to look back how far you've come - compare it to where you wanted to be some time back. We usually do get the things we want - we just don't realize or appreciate them enough.
- Let go of attachment to the object you desire, and desire the experience of staying focused to get it. Then every moment you put into practicing, you are achieving the goal. There is no struggle, no mistakes. Only practice.
- Simplify tasks by breaking them down into components. Make those sections small. Keep time frames for these sections short. Incorporate slowness in your work - so you can give the tasks your full attention. 
- The fastest you can do something is by giving it your full attention and focus, and that is only possible by going intentionally slow.
- Jobs, cars, houses are temporary. You came without them and will go without them. What you learn and experience in this life will stay. You are eternal. Keep that perspective close.
