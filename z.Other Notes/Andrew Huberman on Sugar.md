#sugar 

- There are two parallel pathways in the brain that make you (and pretty much all other animals) seek something sweet:
	- One that makes you seek sweet *tasting* things
	- The other that makes you seek *nutritionally* high sugar foods.
- These neural pathways affect your perception of things under the influence of something sweet - you start finding a lot of foods much more appetising. #sweet-perception 
	- The way this works? **Dopamine** #dopamine 
	- Sweet taste is very potent in activating dopamine release in mesolimbic pathway - especially true for sweet liquids #meso-limbic-pathway 
	- It motivates us into a very focussed action mode to seek more of whatever that sweet thing is 
- But there's another mechanism that works even without perception of sweet taste:
	- Even if there's no initial preference because of a lack of sweet taste or perception - after about 15 minutes of initial consumption, people start preferring the sugar containing food/drink again
	- There are neurons in the gut - called neuropods - that respond to sweet foods without us perceiving the sweetness of food. These neuropods send a signal to the vagus nerve which in turn triggers a dopamine response. 
- Craving/Addiction for anything is proportional to how sharp (increase/time) the rise in dopamine is, not how much the absolute increase is. #dopamine #addiction #craving 
	- Combining fiber or fat with sugary foods slows the rise in glucose levels and thus the rise in dopamine, and therefore leads to less cravings
- Associating a flavour with a glucose spike (say diet coke flavour with cheeseburger), conditions the brain to associate that flavor with increased glucose and releases dopamine and insulin 
	- This means the pathways are not unique to sweet or high glucose things - they can be conditioned to respond to other flavors 
- High amounts of sugar (>4 sugary sodas per week) can lead to increase in symptoms of ADHD #adhd
- Supplements #supplements 
	- Omega-3 fatty acids (and other amino acids and essential fatty acids) trigger the same neuropods that fire when we ingest sugar - making them beneficial for reducing sugar cravings
		- Glutamine can possibly reduce sugar cravings too through the same mechanism
	- Lemon/lime juice can also quickly reduce high blood glucose levels - probably has to do something with the sour taste - which adjusts the neural response to sweet foods.
	- Cinnamon also blunts blood glucose spikes - can be had (upto 1tsp per day) post a big meal to reduce the glucose spike
	- Sleep deprivation or poor quality sleep can lead to more craving for sugary foods #sleep 
		- Deprivation of certain phases of sleep leads to de-regulation of certain neural pathways that can control hunger and metabolism
