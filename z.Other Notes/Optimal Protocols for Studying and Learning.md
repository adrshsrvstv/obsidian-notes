- Best way to learn - access parts of your brain that offsets forgetting new information
- neuroplasticity - ability for nervous system to change in response to a stimuli
	- can be strengthening and weakening of neuron connections
	- can also be creating new neurons - rarer - and not as important to learn
- Testing your knowledge is the best tool to offset forgetting
- Focussing is a primer/cue for learning and neuroplasticity  #focus
	- Sleep helps focus and alertness - you absolutely need it to be right to study and learn #sleep
	- Another thing that helps focus by telling yourself "I need to learn this" silently repeatedly
	- Just like meditation - learn to bring back the focus every time it wanders
	- Meditation can actually help focus
- Actual strengthening and weakening of neural connections actually happens during sleep #sleep 
	- first night after learning something - sleep is important to consolidate that information
- How to structure your days - or learning habits of most successful students:
	1. They schedule time to study #time-management 
	2. They make it a point to isolate themselves - so study alone - and put away/limit distractions
	3. They tell their friends and family about their availability
	4. They break their studying into 2 or 3 sessions - consistently at least 5 days a week
	5. They teach other students - this helps to test and develop mastery - watch one, do one, teach one
	6. Long term motivation to study - connection to life arc and impact on family #motivation 
- Studying that feels **challenging** is the most effective
- Testing #flashcards 
	- Testing oneself on the material is of the best ways to offset forgetting
	- Better than revising or revisiting the same information over and over in terms of accurate recall
	- Study once + 3 Tests  > Studying thrice + 1 Test > Studying 4 times
	- Testing helps you identify the gaps in your knowledge - don't know something or understood something incorrectly and fix them - that's what makes it better
	- **Testing immediately (same day) after studying helps consolidate things better** vs testing with a delay
	- Familiarity != Mastery. When we just study and don't test, we are familiar but don't go for mastery - errors help us lock in the new information
- How to test:
	- The best tests as study tools are open ended, short answer, minimal prompt tests. (Unlike MCQs)
	- The questions should have some amount of depth and involve some effort to answer.
	- Tell yourself that you are going to take a certain number of tests to AID your learning
	- Test yourself immediately after learning - think about the material, test yourself - instead of going on your phone
- Gap Effect:
	- "Gap effects are.... .... ... Exactly this"
	- Think of them as micro tests throughout learning
- Other tools:
	- Our brains are wired to change quickly in response to  emotional experiences - like a scarring scary experience - almost a one shot learning. Not the good kind of learning
	- Stories, also because of the emotional component of it - help in learning better.
		- In the medieval times, people would plunge themselves into cold water after learning to spike adrenaline and the emotional response
	- Caffeine helps in alertness and epinephrine - can help to learn better
