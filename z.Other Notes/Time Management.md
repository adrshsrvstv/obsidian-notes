## [Where do the hours go?](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2013/03/hours) 

- People tend to overestimate how long it will take to complete short tasks and underestimate the time longer projects will take. Then there's the fact that we forget to schedule time for the basics.
- **Audit your time**: Take a week to keep track of exactly how you spend your time, Pychyl suggests. Be it showering, eating or doing laundry, every activity should be tracked.
- **Use time blocks**: If you're a morning person, set aside a couple of hours in the morning to study. Block says she tends to work best by doing what she calls "chunking," where she does certain tasks on certain days. "I found that shifting my mindset too many times during the day — between conducting research, attending practicum for a few hours, and then visiting another site to see patients, for example — made me inefficient," she says. "But if I lump all research into one day, and practice into another, I am able to concentrate all of my attention on what I'm doing." #to-do-lists #calendar #time-blocking 
- **Leave little room for negotiation** once you put something on your agenda, Pychyl says. "There's no starting the task at 10:15 a.m. if you said you're going to start it at 10 a.m.," he says. "You have to honor your schedule as if it's set in stone, because otherwise you're setting the precedent that these things don't matter."
- **Just get started**: Truth is that your motivational state does not have to match the task at hand," he says. "Very often, attitudes follow behavior, so just get started."
- Use small chunks of time
- **Abandon perfection** : If there's an assignment that's not crucial to your realm of study, but that you're required to complete, Chang recommends giving yourself only a set amount of time to do it. "Once that time limit is up, consider the product ‘good enough' and move on to the next task,"

## [Why time management is ruining our lives](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/22/why-time-management-is-ruining-our-lives)

- Part of the problem is simply that thinking about time encourages clockwatching, which has been repeatedly shown in studies to undermine the quality of work. In one representative experiment from 2008, US researchers asked people to complete the Iowa gambling task, a venerable decision-making test that involves selecting playing cards in order to win a modest amount of cash. All participants were given the same time in which to complete the task – but some were told that time would probably be sufficient, while others were warned it would be tight. Contrary to an intuition cherished especially among journalists – that the pressure of deadlines is what forces them to produce high-quality work – the second group performed far less well. ==The mere awareness of their limited time triggered anxious emotions that got in the way of performance.== 

## Ali Abdaal on

- You own all of your time - you are doing what you most want to do at any point of time. Make sure that is true most of the time. 
- Have a dump for things you want to do to get them out of your head. but not in your main to do list. that's deliberate. #to-do-lists 
- Artificial deadlines for things that'd just take more time otherwise without making much of a difference. 
- Have protected time where you know you won't have interruptions.
- Have a daily highlight - one single task that you most want to finish.
- At the end of the day, you can choose to be happy with what you were able to accomplish, or you can choose to feel bad about not getting done enough.

- A good to-do tool ought to ease the Zeigarnik effect. ==Speccing out what you’re going to do—getting it outside of your head—seems to help you stop perseverating==.
- Something about the future defeats our imaginative capacity. We regard our future self as a stranger, someone onto whose lap we can dump tons of work. On some weird level, we don’t get that it’ll be us doing it.
- We overload ourselves with more than we can accomplish and create Lists of Shame because we are terrible at grasping how little time we actually have. ==The only solution, this line of thinking goes, is to use an organizational system that is itself composed of time: a calendar==. Instead of putting tasks on a list, you do “time blocking,” putting every task in your calendar as a chunk of work. That way you can immediately see when you’re biting off more than you can chew. #time-blocking
- Weeks or months later, your Todoist app is a teetering ziggurat of tasks, too painful even to behold. Omer Perchik, the creator of another app—Any.do—calls this problem “the List of Shame.” #to-do-lists 
- Paper forces you to repetitively rewrite tasks, as when, say, you transfer all last week’s undone to-dos to this week’s list, or when you erase and rewrite calendar events. #to-do-lists 
- The usefulness of paper here cuts to the real heart of what makes to-do management such a grim problem. Every to-do list is a midlife crisis of unfulfilled promise. ==Winnowing away things you’ll never do in a weekly review is crucial==, yet we dread it for what it says about the boundaries of existence. Our fragile psyches find it easier to build up a list of shame, freak out, and flee. #to-do-lists 

## [5 Strategies for Getting More Work Done in Less Time](https://hbr.org/2019/01/5-strategies-for-getting-more-work-done-in-less-time)

- To speed up your process on routine items, come up with a template or checklist or find ones you can use. For example, I have a template email that I fill in every year to send to my accountant with my year-end tax information. And on a monthly basis, I go through a monthly finances checklist. You might want templates for activities like putting together weekly reports, presentations, or meeting agendas. Also, you may find checklists valuable for weekly planning, one-on-one meetings, or other repeated activities. Both templates and checklists allow you to do a good job in less time because you don’t need to spend any time remembering what to do or deciding on the next step. You can keep these templates and checklists in a more sophisticated system, but I find that often simply having them recorded in a Word document is sufficient.
- **Clarify Actual Expectations** : When you take on a significant task, talk with any key stakeholders about what they expect from you. Perhaps they need a PowerPoint deck, or perhaps they don’t. Perhaps they need an A+ job or maybe a B+ will be fine. Perhaps they need a comprehensive plan or maybe just an initial sketch will work.
