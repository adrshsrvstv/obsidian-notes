# How to Launch Again & Again - Kathleen Ma√±alac
- People think the launch is a one time opportunity and has to be perfect
	- People don't care - if you take 6 months to prepare a launch, you'll be dead by then
	- Launch fast and launch again and again
- When should you launch then? 
	- RIGHT NOW!
	- Don't let your theoretical notions of how you're going to solve the problem come in the way of getting the actual feedback and iterating over it
	- Airbnb launched 3 times! If you launch and nobody notices - iterate and launch again
	- Launch and iterate until you have a core of users (if only 10) who LOVE you.
- But I'm an exception! NOOOO!
	- Doesn't matter if you're biotech, aerospace, or futuristic tech
- How should you launch
	- A CLEAR idea is your foundation
	- Founders should be able to explain this idea as clearly and succinctly as possible - at a 5 year old level
	- How?
		- Lead with what, not why.
			- Give people the context upfront and get to the point - who you are and WHAT you do
			- Backstory later - tell people WHAT you're building first
			- People have short attention spans - don't lose them in first 10 seconds
		- No meaningless jargon - tell people what you ACTUALLY do - not some coorporate bullshit
			- People should immediately get an idea about what EXACTLY you do
			- X for Y constructions - "uber for food", "airbnb for officespace" - are overused analogies, and try to avoid them if it's easy to say what you do in a different way
		- Best one liners for your company are short, descriptive, have little jargon, and let people see what you've built without bullshit or backstory
	- Types of Launches:
		- Silent launch: 
			- domain
			- company name
			- description
			- contact
			- call for action ("Sign up for our launch!")
		- Friends and Family Launch:
			- Do it as soon as you have an MVP
			- Don't stay here for too long
			- Take their feedback, but iterate and move on quickly, because they may not be your ideal customers, and their feedback may not matter so much
		- Strangers:
			- Doordash had it's MVP out in a few hours (after they had talked to about 200 of restuarant owners)
			- Don't wait too long to launch to strangers else you'll miss early feedback
		- Online Communities:
			- HN, Discord, Startup School internal forum
			- Be authentic - write like you talk. No jargons, no showy flowy writing -nobody has time for that.
		- Pre-order Launch:
			- If you're a hardware company - you can launch on indiegogo or kickstarter - though there are caveats and people are increasingly becoming sceptical of these.
		- Waitlist launch:
			- If you are unsure of how many people you can take on - try waitlists and see if people want it.
			- Just don't sit on your waitlists for too long
			- But launch to everyone as soon as you can.
		- Build a community:
			- Launch again and again on the same platforms (HN, reddit, twitter) and take direct questions from your customers supporters and sceptics.

# How to Talk to Users
- Talk to users throughout the lifetime of your company.
	- Brian Chesky still takes calls from airbnb customers
- How to interview potential customers?
	- Video/phone/or in person - no in writing. (Although, there are customer groups very hard to talk to. Make it possible for them to have an email conversation - cuz they really may not have 20 minutes to talk to you.)
	- build rapport
	- DON'T introduce your idea till the very end
	- LISTEN, not talk
	- Ask open ended questions
	- Take notes
- Questions to ask:
	- Tell me how you do X today
	- What is the hardest thing you're doing about X
	- Why is it hard
	- How often do you do X
	- Why is  it important for you company to do X
	- What have you done to solve this problem for yourself
- Questions to NOT ask:
	- Will you use our product?
	- Which features would make product x better? (Users have good problems but BAD solutions, they also have no incentive to saying NO to features - they'll say yes to everything)
	- yes/no questions
	- How would a better product look like? (They are not product managers)
- After the interview:
	- Put major points from your notes on sticky notes and connect them  - see the patterns and find an MVP out of that
	- Don't over intellectualize though!
	- Keep users involved:
		- Create a Slack/Whatsapp group with them
		- Give them exclusive access to your prototypes and make them feel special
- Choose your users wisely:
	- People like contractors or plumbers or doctors don't change their tools very often - they may not be very open to change
	- Startups on the other hand are changing all the time and will be very open to trying new things
