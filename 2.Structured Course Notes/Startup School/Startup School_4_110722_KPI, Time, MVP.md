# MVP - Siegel
- Why don't people build MVPs:
	- Fear - What do you fear will happen if your MVP sucks?
	- Fake Steve Jobs Confidence: Let me just build a perfect thing!
		- Except that the real Jobs never built perfect products - even the first iphone sucked in hundreds of ways
- Basic Spec for MVP:
	- Very fast to build - weeks not months to ship
	- Very limited functionality
	- Appeal to a small set of users
		- Solve problems for folks with the most pain -  people with hair-on-fire problems
		-  ![hair on fire problem | 200](attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-07-11%20at%2010.45.44%20PM.png)
		- You could obviously sell a bucket of water to someone with their hair on fire. But, you could also sell them a brick. Their HAIR is on FIRE!! They will buy your brick to beat the fire out with it!
- Why MVP though? Can't I just survey my customers?
	- Customers are good at telling you whether they like your product or not, but not good at telling you what exactly they want to solve their problems.
	- So talk to users with an MVP - you'll learn more from the customer that way
- How to build MVP:
	- Time box your spec
	- WRITE your spec - don't just have it in your head.
	- Cut 30 - 50% of the first spec
	- Don't fall in love with the MVP or your product. Be in love with your customer or their problems
	- "Better to have a 100 people who love your product, than a 100K who KINDA like it."
- Hardware products are much harder to iterate and test hypothesis and re-iterate - 10X harder than just software products.
- How do you compete with an entrenched big incumbent:
	- Pick the battlefield that YOU want to fight on ("We are the fastest payment integration you could get", not what the incumbent has chosen for you ("We have 200 features!")

# Prioritization
- How do spend your time as a founder:
	- Goal: Get to product market fit as quick as possible
- KPI - metrics that you track and report on - internally and externally
	- They tell you if what you are doing is helping you to get to your goal of finding product market fit
- Prioritizations - which things you do today - AND the super important things you DON'T do today. You'll never get to everything on your task list.
- Insight: Use KPIs to prioritize your time and tasks. Prioritize what moves your top KPIs
- In a startup, speed matters. Run fast, but make sure it's in the right direction. Don't waste time on useless things that don't matter.
- What are wastes of time:
	- Optimizing paperwork
	- Perfecting things
	- Premature optimization
	- Choosing intellectually hard problems instead of something that people can immediately use
- To prioritise:
	- Identify KPIs. This should usually be revenue growth for a launched startup - a non-revenue KPI is rarely the right one
		- What are your goals this week? Have laser focus on weekly growth goals
		- Find what your bottleneck to KPI growth is.
		- How to move KPIs:
			- Rank ideas that help you remove blockers for your biggest KPIs
			- Track KPI as you work on those ideas. Be honest if this moves your KPI. If not, why?
			- Do retros - honestly. Change what doesn't work, double down if it does.
			- Move fast.
			- Try a few ideas fast, talk to users fast, build and iterate fast, see if it works.
			- Perfectionism and indecision are your enemy - **fast decisions are good decisions**. Make a quick decision, fail quickly, learn quickly. Pick a decision, keep moving.
	- What isn't useful:
		- Fake progress:
			- investor coffees
			- conferences
			- Arbitrary technical milestones
		- Mitigating downsides instead of chasing upside.
			- Fixing little problems is easy, but nor where the growth happens.
			- Innovation and creativity need risk taking and are what actually lead to growth.
		- Working on secondary problems
		- Not being honest with yourself when things aren't working.
			- Fast growth coming out of good product market fit feels **fundamentally different** from slow growth.
- Primary and Secondary KPI:
	- Primary:
		- Tells if your business is working
		- Most commonly revenue growth
	- Secondary:
		- Things that can be tracked to make sure you're not cheating/gaming your primary KPI
		- Small and relevant
		- e.g. Unit economics, retention/churn/acquisition cost and payback period
		- Be warned - these ARE NOT YOUR PRIMARY KPIs. Primary ones always take the priority on decisions. e.g. Optimizing for both revenue and unit economics can lead to a slow growth . Slow growth is a no man's land and may eventually kill you. 
- How much growth is enough?
	- Early growth matters - growth compounds
	- 5-7% weekly - good
	- 10% weekly - exceptional
	- Other factors to consider:
		- Paid vs organic growth (Do organic early on - don't waste money on ads/promos)
		- Retention vs engagement (Short answer - do both. But optimize for most impact on revenue KPIs)
	- Non-revenue KPIs:
		- Customer acquisition cost / long term value. 
		- Free signups/ Daily active users - good options for "network effect" products like marketplaces
