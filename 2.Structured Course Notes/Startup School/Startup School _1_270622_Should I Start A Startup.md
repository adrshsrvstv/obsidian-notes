# Geoff Ralston Intro
### Why start a startup?
- Money? Fame? Glamour?
	- These are really bad reasons and removed from reality
	- Startups are REALLY HARD
	- But also really rewarding in ways other than the above reasons
- You control your destiny - and in doing so, at times change the world
- Ask yourself: What drives you? What sustains you?
### Why don't people start a startup?
- Perhaps the top is Inertia in our lifestyles and in the safety of our secure jobs
- But also, the peer pressure and expectations from friends and family and parents - to have a steady income and climb corporate ladders

# Harj Tagger - Should I Start A Startup?
- Very hard to figure who will be a successful founder and who won't be
- School and work life successes are not very good indicators
- Even being really successful at FAANG isn't a very good indicator you'll make a good startup founder
	- Because you have learned how to build, but not how to get people to try your product - that's not a problem big companies have anymore
	- It takes a huge amount of RESILIENCE to convince a single person to try your product - and that is probably the best indicator of startup success we have
- What's a signal for resilience?
	- Motivation? 
		- Not really - motivations can change over time.
		- Love for the product and love for the people you work with are among the more enduring motivations
		- Curiosity about the startup life is another perfectly fine motivation
		- So is making life changing amounts of money in a short period of time
		- Don't worry about starting motivations too much though
- Practical advice:
	- Ask yourself: What do you have to lose?
		- Do a worst case scenario analysis of what happens if you started a company and it doesn't work out. Can you live with that? It generally takes about a year to figure if the venture is worth your time. Is the experience worth the  opportunity cost of that year for you?
		- If not, your own anxiety at some point might end up sabotaging your startup
	- Don't drop out of college please!
		- Yes Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg exist, but in general, college will prove to be quite a valuable experience
		- Drop out if you really feel college is not the thing for you in life, but not just to start a company
	- Startup experience helps with career opportunities even if they don't work out - there are people who exclusively look for past founders to hire for their own companies
	- Even in your worst case scenario - do consider the experience of starting a startup and the fact that it could help you in your career in your future
- So, where do you start?
	- Don't see finding ideas and founders as two separate tasks.
	- Let your ideas be fuzzy and seek out smart people and have proactive conversations with them 
	- What if you don't have such an environment? Change it! 
		- Another startup is probably the best such place
		- Early employees of startups generally make good future founders
		- How do you find such jobs? Mail the founders! Or, https://www.workatastartup.com 
	- Turn ideas into side projects and launch them
		- Most often, they'll get mixed feedback
		- But that's OK! Much better to have a product a few people really love, than to have a product that everyone is indifferent to.
		- But more importantly, don't bother with the results too much when doing side projects, see how you like the process.
		-  If you enjoy the process, and can find a co-founder - make the jump!
