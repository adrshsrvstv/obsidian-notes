### Outline

- Planning in RL - problems traditionally
	- planning using informative priors
- diffusion models - get from diffusion survey paper
- diffusion models in RL - get from diff4rl paper
- Diffuser paper
- Schr√∂dinger bridges
- I2SB paper

## Planning with a learned model


## Problem Setting
- What do we do
- how do we define it
- some challenges?
- some terms in it and what they mean



Why have this even? shouldn't this be part of introduction?

We need to sort of define the problem for further investigation at least


Do we talk about priors here? or in intro itself.

Priors are things very particular to our approach - Maybe introduce them in the approach part. 

So just talk about planning with trajectory optimisation as a problem and then move on.

Diffuser approach - 1 hour

Diffusion in RL - 30 minutes

Fixing other parts of background - 30 minutes.

take a break - 30 minutes : till 9:30

Writing an Intro - 2 hours more till around 12

Take a break - go home 

Writing related papers section: 1 hour more till around 1:30

sleep from 2 till around 8AM: wake up and work 

Tomorrow - pre write conclusion - see what conclusions you can better without experiments 

Aim to submit by 21st morning - only case we can wait is if we have results of experiments already. 



See if there is time for an experiment

22, 23, 24, 25 for prof to approve
